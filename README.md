#Dragonfly Marketplace

### A Multi-Vendor, Multi-Platform Immersive Application

**Platforms**: Windows • Android (Testing) • iOS (Planned)
**Engine**: Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprint + C++)
**Tools**: Rhino, Grasshopper, Unreal Engine, C++, Blueprints
**Type**: Real-time interactive marketplace with symbolic world design and vendor architecture

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Dragonfly** is an immersive, symbolic, and interactive 3D **multi-vendor marketplace** built for **Windows** and mobile platforms (Android for testing, **iOS planned**).

Designed to function as a real-time explorable marketplace rather than a static online store, Dragonfly merges **e-commerce functionality** with **game-like navigation**, creating a unique space where real-world brands can showcase and sell their products within a symbolic digital landscape.

## 🧠 Concept & Design Philosophy

This project originated from a client’s vision to create a **marketplace shaped like a dragonfly**, inspired by its symbolism of **good fortune and positive energy** in many Arabian cultures.

From that idea, the design evolved into a full **island-shaped environment** modeled after the dragonfly’s wings and body, where each vendor booth is housed within a **cell-like architectural module**, echoing the organic cellular structure found in dragonfly wings.

> This approach turned the marketplace into a **living architectural organism**, where each vendor becomes a part of a greater symbolic and visual experience.

## 🛠 Development Pipeline

I led the **entire development process** from concept to code:

* ✅ **Procedural Design** using **Rhino + Grasshopper** to generate the island and building forms based on dragonfly wing geometry.
* ✅ **Level Design** and integration in **Unreal Engine 5**, using **Lumen** for global illumination and **Nanite** for detailed rendering.
* ✅ Core functionality written with a **hybrid Blueprint and C++ system** for flexibility and performance.
* ✅ **Top-down RTS-style navigation** implemented to guide users naturally across the environment while interacting with brand zones.
* ✅ Integrated **UI/UX** elements for vendor booths, navigation, and asset exploration.

## 📱 Cross-Platform Status

* 🖥 **Windows**: Fully functional with high-fidelity rendering and full navigation support.
* 📱 **Android**: Used as a testing platform for mobile optimization. Supports mid to high-end devices.
* 🍎 **iOS**: Planned platform for deployment. Cross-platform design ensures seamless integration in the future.

> ⚙️ Ongoing optimization is in place to ensure smooth mobile performance, including adaptive LOD, scalable material systems, and hardware-aware asset streaming.

## 🛒 Marketplace Ecosystem Features

* 🏪 **Vendor Booths**: Each brand or business occupies a designated structural cell (wing unit), modeled to reflect organic fractal harmony.
* 🖼️ **Asset Display**: Vendors can display 3D models, media, or interactive product showcases within their space.
* 🧭 **Exploration-first UX**: Users explore the marketplace in real-time, interact with spaces, and access vendor-specific info directly in the world.
* 🧾 **Transaction-ready Integration**: Planned support for product linking and transaction layers via embedded web or custom API.

## 🧪 Current Status

The project is currently in **testing and optimization** phase. Android builds are available for selected testers, and the **Windows version is ready for publishing**.

External file hosting will be used to distribute `.exe` and `.apk` files due to size limitations on GitHub.

> Links to downloads will be provided in the [Releases](https://github.com/) section upon public launch.

## 🔮 Vision

**Dragonfly** goes beyond being an application—it’s a **digital ecosystem**, a **symbolic architecture**, and a **community-first marketplace** that invites users not just to shop, but to **explore, discover, and engage**.

This is a fusion of architecture, gaming, and commerce—creating a marketplace that feels alive.
